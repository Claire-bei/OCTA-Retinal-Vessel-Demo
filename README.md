# OCTA Retinal Vessel Demo

This repository contains a simple yet effective Python demo for retinal vessel preprocessing and edge detection using a real OCTA (Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography) image.

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical skills in medical image enhancement and vessel segmentation using Python-based libraries such as OpenCV and matplotlib. This serves as a foundational step toward applying computational methods in ophthalmology and AI-related translational research.

## 🗂️ Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `octa_image.png` | A real OCTA en-face retinal image used for processing |
| `octa_notebook.ipynb` | The Jupyter notebook that performs CLAHE-based contrast enhancement and Canny edge detection |
| `README.md` | Project documentation (this file) |

## 🔧 Methods Used

- **CLAHE**: Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization
- **Canny**: Edge detection algorithm
- **OpenCV**: Image processing library
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization

## 📊 Output

The notebook produces:
- Original Image
- Enhanced Image
- Edge Map

# 📌 OCTA Retinal Vessel Quantification – Advanced Analysis

This project demonstrates advanced quantification techniques for **retinal OCTA images**, including image enhancement, vessel skeleton extraction, denoising, and vessel morphology measurements using **OpenCV**, **skimage**, and **NumPy**.

---

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ CLAHE enhancement for improving vessel visibility  
- ✅ Otsu thresholding for adaptive binarization  
- ✅ Small object removal to clean background noise  
- ✅ Skeleton extraction of vessel map  
- ✅ Quantitative metrics:
  - Vessel density (percentage)
  - Total vessel length (in pixels)
  - Number of branch points
  - Average vessel width (via distance transform)
- ✅ Overlay visualization and image export
